# EXL-100-SWITCHED-KEYBOARD
A replacement keyboard for the EXL-100 using keyboard switches with an on-board joystick port

# PCB
All of the components are marked on the PCB. The IR diodes need to be 880nm, you should be able to find these most places, I got mine from Amazon.

# Casing
The OpenScad file will let you generate the letter and number keys, there are also separate STLs for the Space Bar, Enter and function keys
The main casing has two zip files, one for printers with Multi Material capabilities, like the Bambu, and one for single material printers.
There are slots for connecting the various pieces together, these are designed to hold 3mm nuts. If you have a larger printer you can stitch these pieces together.
I've also included the Autodesk Fusion source file.
